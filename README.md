The Treemap provides a clear, intuitive view of product categories and subcategories by market value, making complex datasets easy to interpret for non-technical stakeholders.

## Data Structure

The Treemap is based on the following hierarchical data:

```
Category > Subcategory > Value
```

Sample:

```
Clothing > Men's > 950000
Electronics > Phones > 720000
Home & Garden > Furniture > 310000
```
